# Websockets using Go standard library
This implementation is mainly for my own learnings to understand Go more and the underlying mechanics of websockets.

This is still WIP but if you'd like to give it a run, feel free to go through the steps below to get started

## Prereqs
- Go

## Steps
- `cd` into the root of the folder
- start the Go server -> `go run .`
- open the index.html file twice

## Todo
- [ ] create and fix project structure 
- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] create htmx client instead 
- [ ] other things i cant think of right now
